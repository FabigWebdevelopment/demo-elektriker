# Image Generation Prompt Examples

## Quick Reference: Key Prompt Elements

This document shows the essential components of our ultra-detailed prompts that make them convert 10x better than generic prompts.

---

## Thomas Müller Persona (Consistent Across All Images)

### Physical Appearance (Copy-paste into every prompt)

```
Physical appearance (consistent):
- Age: 42 years old (early 40s, mature and experienced but energetic)
- Hair: Short, well-groomed dark brown hair with slight grey at temples
- Face: Confident, approachable expression with warm smile
- Eyes: Direct eye contact, intelligent and trustworthy gaze
- Build: Athletic but not overly muscular, fit from physical work
- Skin: Slightly tanned from outdoor work, healthy complexion
- Facial hair: Clean-shaven or very short well-maintained stubble
```

**Why This Works:**
- Specific age (42) not "middle-aged"
- Grey at temples = experience without looking old
- Tanned skin = actually does physical work (not desk-only)
- Athletic build = active, capable, healthy

---

## German Electrical Standards (Technical Accuracy)

### VDE Wire Color Codes

```
Color-coded wiring (German standard - CRITICAL accuracy):
- Brown: Phase/Live (L)
- Black: Phase/Live (L2 in three-phase)
- Grey: Phase/Live (L3 in three-phase)
- Blue: Neutral (N)
- Green-Yellow: Protective Earth (PE)
- Wires perfectly arranged in this color order
```

**Why This Matters:**
- Wrong colors = instant "this is fake" reaction from German electricians
- Shows we understand German VDE standards (not US NEC)
- Builds trust: "They know their stuff"

### German Electrical Brands (Real > Generic)

**Always specify real brands:**
- Smart Home: Loxone, KNX, Gira, Jung
- Electrical Panels: Hager, ABB, Siemens
- Tools: Wera, Knipex, Fluke, Wiha
- Certifications: VDE, Meister certificate

**Why:**
- Generic "smart panel" looks like stock photo
- "Loxone panel" looks like real project documentation

---

## Photography Specifications

### Professional Camera Settings

```
Photography style:
- Shot on Canon EOS R5, 85mm f/1.4 lens at f/2.0
- Shallow depth of field, background softly blurred
- Sharp focus on eyes/subject
- Natural skin tones, minimal retouching
- Professional corporate portrait style but approachable
- Color grading: Slightly warm tones, professional blues
```

**Why This Works:**
- Specific camera/lens = AI understands exact look
- f/2.0 aperture = specific depth of field
- "Warm tones, professional blues" = color grading direction

### Lighting Setup

```
Background & lighting:
- Soft grey or white professional backdrop with subtle gradient
- Studio lighting: Key light from 45° creating dimensional modeling
- Rim light separating subject from background
- Soft fill light to reduce harsh shadows
- Professional but warm atmosphere
```

**Why:**
- "45° key light" is specific technique
- Rim light = professional portrait separation
- Not just "good lighting" but exact setup

---

## German Cultural Triggers

### Meister Psychology

```
Mood & psychology:
- German Meister pride: "Qualität, Erfahrung, Vertrauen"
- German craftsmanship: "Handwerk hat goldenen Boden"
- "Das ist Qualität" (This is quality)
- "Dem vertraue ich mein Haus an" (I trust this person with my home)
```

**Why German Phrases:**
- Target audience is German homeowners
- Emotional triggers in native language are 10x stronger
- Shows cultural understanding

### Trust Signals

```
Visual craftsmanship signals:
- VDE certification badge visible on collar
- Meister certificate partially visible in background (blurred)
- Wedding ring visible (signals stability and trustworthiness)
- Simple quality watch (success without arrogance)
- Quality branded tools (Wera, Knipex, Fluke)
```

**Why These Work:**
- VDE badge = legally required certification
- Meister certificate = highest qualification level
- Wedding ring = stable, trustworthy family man
- Quality watch (not Rolex) = successful but relatable

---

## Critical Exclusions (What NOT to Include)

### Always Include This Section

```
CRITICAL: NO stock photo smile, NO overly formal suit,
NO harsh lighting, NO generic corporate backdrop,
NO visible company logos (just VDE badge),
NO crossed arms defensive pose, NO extreme close-up,
NO messy wiring, NO chaotic workspace,
NO old technology, NO unsafe practices,
NO posed looking at camera,
NO generic "contractor" stock photo,
NO dirty clothes or hands (clean professional)
```

**Why This Matters:**
- AI has bias toward stock photo clichés
- Explicit exclusions override default behavior
- "NO crossed arms" = don't look defensive
- "NO dirty clothes" = professional, not "construction worker"

---

## Target Emotion (Most Important Line)

### Always End With This

```
Target emotion: "Der wirkt kompetent und sympathisch"
(He seems competent and likeable)
```

**Other Examples:**
- "Das ist kein Pfuscher - das ist ein echter Profi" (This is no hack - this is a real professional)
- "Ich will auch so ein System" (I want a system like this too)
- "Das sieht professionell installiert aus" (This looks professionally installed)
- "Der nimmt sich Zeit für uns" (He takes time for us)

**Why This Works:**
- Tells AI the exact psychological outcome desired
- German phrases trigger cultural authenticity
- Specific emotion > "professional look"

## Common Mistakes

### ❌ Mistake 1: Too Generic

```
"Professional German electrician installing smart home system"
```

**Problem:** AI will generate generic stock photo
**Fix:** Add 300+ words of specific details

### ❌ Mistake 2: Wrong Cultural Context

```
"Electrician wearing hard hat installing outlet"
```

**Problem:** Hard hat = construction site, not residential service
**Fix:** "Clean professional work shirt, VDE badge, modern home interior"

### ❌ Mistake 3: No Exclusions

**Problem:** AI includes stock photo clichés by default
**Fix:** Always add CRITICAL section listing what NOT to include

### ❌ Mistake 4: Inconsistent Persona

```
Image 1: "45-year-old man with beard"
Image 2: "40-year-old clean-shaven man"
```

**Problem:** Thomas looks different in every image
**Fix:** Copy-paste Block 1 (consistent appearance) into EVERY prompt

### ❌ Mistake 5: No Emotional Target

**Problem:** Generic professional look, no specific feeling
**Fix:** Always end with "Target emotion:" + German phrase

---

## Advanced: Variations

### Generate Variations of Same Scene

**Base Prompt:** Thomas installing smart home panel

**Variation 1:** Close-up on hands
```
Add: "Macro photography focus on hands working with wires,
Thomas's face visible but slightly out of focus in background"
```

**Variation 2:** Wide shot showing context
```
Add: "Wide angle shot (24mm lens) showing full room context,
Thomas in middle ground, smart home panel visible"
```

**Variation 3:** Over-the-shoulder perspective
```
Add: "Over-the-shoulder view from Thomas's perspective,
focus on the panel he's working on, hands visible in foreground"
```

**Result:** 10x better images that look professional instead of stock photos.
